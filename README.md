**Overview**

This repository focuses on the sigmoid activation function in Deep Neural Networks (DNN). The sigmoid function is widely used in machine learning and deep learning models, particularly in binary classification tasks, due to its ability to map any real-valued input into a range between 0 and 1.

**The repository explores:**

- The mathematical formulation of the sigmoid function.
- Applications of the sigmoid function in neural networks.
- Visualization of the sigmoid curve and its derivative.
- Implementation in Python and its usage in deep learning frameworks.

**Key Features**

**Sigmoid Function Basics:**
â€‹
**Visualization:**

- Plot the sigmoid function to demonstrate its S-shaped curve.
- Visualize the derivative of the sigmoid to understand its gradient behavior.

**Applications:**

- Binary classification in neural networks.
- Output activation for logistic regression models.
- Probabilistic interpretations in classification tasks.

**Limitations:**

- Analysis of vanishing gradients and its impact on training deep networks.

**Implementation:**

- Code snippets in Python using NumPy and Matplotlib.
- Use cases with TensorFlow/Keras and PyTorch.
